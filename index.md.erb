RabbitMQ is a fast and dependable open-source message server that supports a wide range of use cases including reliable integration, content based routing and global data delivery, and high volume monitoring and data ingestion.

Emerging as the defacto standard for cloud messaging, RabbitMQ is used for efficient communication between servers, applications and devices, and creates lasting value by enabling rapid development of modern decentralized application and data architectures that can scale with your business needs.
The Pivotal CF installer enables cloud operators to deploy a RabbitMQ service in Pivotal CF. You can deploy the service as a single node or a cluster.

## <a id="features"></a>Features

* The RabbitMQ service enables application developers to provision protocol plugins and management API access to the deployed RabbitMQ service for their Pivotal CF applications. Each service instance corresponds to a unique RabbitMQ vhost (virtual host), and each service binding corresponds to a unique user with access limited to the vhost of the bound service instance. The management  user interface is accessible to developers through the Pivotal CF console.
* The service can be configured to require SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) connections for AMQP 0-9-1, MQTT, STOMP, and the management API.
* The deployment includes a load balancer in front of the clustered RabbitMQ nodes to provide resource balancing between the nodes. Applications can connect to the service without any awareness of the cluster topology. 
* The initial configuration, including the number of nodes and their specifications, a list of enabled plugins, and other parameters can be altered dynamically later. You can upgrade RabbitMQ and its dependencies later to suit your development needs.
* The RabbitMQ management API, user and command-line interfaces are available to operators and application developers, the latter with non-administrator privileges. The administrative command-line interface is available to operators only. 
* Pivotal CF deploys open-source RabbitMQ. Support for Pivotal RabbitMQ is expected at a later date.
