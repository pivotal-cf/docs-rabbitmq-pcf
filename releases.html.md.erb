## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

Pivotal recommends that you upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.14.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.14.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.15.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="deprecation"></a> Pivotal Is Continuing Support for the Pre-Provisioned Service

<%= vars.note_pre_provisioned %>

For information about migrating from the pre-provisioned service to the on-demand
service, see
[About Migrating a Pre-Provisioned Instance to an On-Demand Instance](./ondemand.html#migrating-from-mt).
For instructions on how to install, configure, and deploy RabbitMQ for PCF
as an on-demand service, see <a href="./install-config.html">

## <a id="1159"></a> v1.15.9

**Release Date**: May XX, 2019

### Resolved Issue

This release fixes the following issue:

* RabbitMQ for PCF v1.15.8. could fail to deploy on Pivotal Application Service (PAS) 2.4.4 and earlier. See [v1.15.8 - Withdrawn](#1158).

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Pre-provisioned broker does not terminate failed connections<br><br>

    When an invalid create, delete, bind, or unbind request is made, the pre-provisioned broker fails to terminate the connection to the RabbitMQ instance.<br><br>

    Over time, this can cause the memory on the VM hosting the pre-provisioned broker to reach capacity. This requires a restart of the VM. Until the lack of memory is resolved, the app developer is less able to create, delete, bind, and unbind services to apps.<br><br>

    The operation of the RabbitMQ instances is unaffected.<br><br>

* **[Security Issue]** The method for generating the Erlang cookie is not secure.
  For more information about this security issue, see
    <a href="https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279">CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie</a>.
  * If you rely on the tile to generate the cookie by leaving the Erlang cookie
  field blank, see [Security Issue with the Tile Generated Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang-security-issue).
  * If you have set the Erlang cookie explicitly in the tile configuration,
  you are not affected by this issue.

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value requires cluster downtime, and can result in failed deployments.

    For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

* Changing networks or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.

    For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

* When errand run rules are set to **When Changed**, Ops Manager might not run the errands when the tile has relevant changes.
  * For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).
  * Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

### Packages

### Packages

* OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.9
* Erlang v20.3.8.15
* HAProxy v1.6.13

## <a id="1152"></a> v1.15.2

**Release Date**: December 20, 2018

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* The "upgrade all service instances" errand defaults to upgrading in parallel.
You can configure this using the **Maximum number of instances upgraded in parallel** field.

    For more information about this field, see [Configure Global Settings](./install-config.html#global).

* Supports the Log Cache cf CLI plugin that enables developers to access logs
for an on-demand service instance using the command `cf tail`.

    For more information about this feature, see
    [Access RabbitMQ Metrics for On-Demand Service Instances](./use.html#log-cache).

* For on-demand service instances, the Erlang cookie and the RabbitMQ admin password are stored in the BOSH Credhub. This requires port 8844 on the BOSH Director to be accessible from the On-Demand Broker.

* The `rabbitmq_consistent_hash_exchange` and `rabbitmq_sharding` plugins are enabled.

    For more information, see [RabbitMQ Server Settings That Cannot Be Disabled](./install-config.html#no-overwrite).

* Adds mutual TLS between service metrics and the Loggregator system.

* Removes credentials from the dashboard URL in the pre-provisioned service.

* The maximum number of on-demand services instances that can be deployed has been increased to 200.

* Set swap to 1 GB for RabbitMQ nodes.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* **[Security Issue]** The method for generating the Erlang Cookie is not secure.
  For more information about this security issue, see
    <a href="https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279">CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie</a>.
  * If you rely on the tile to generate the cookie by leaving the Erlang cookie
  field blank, see [Security Issue with the Tile Generated Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang-security-issue).
  * If you have set the Erlang Cookie explicitly in the tile configuration,
  you are not affected by this issue.

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value require cluster downtime, and can result in failed deployments.

    For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

* Changing networks and/or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.

    For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

  * For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).
  * Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

* The maximum number of file descriptors is not set.
Therefore, RabbitMQ instances use the default value from the operating system.

### Packages

* OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.9
* Erlang v20.3.8.15
* HAProxy v1.6.13
