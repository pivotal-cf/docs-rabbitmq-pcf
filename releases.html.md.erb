## <a id="upgrade"></a> Upgrade to the Latest Version

<%= partial 'do-not-upgrade' %>

To upgrade from 1.12.x to 1.13.x, you **must** upgrade to the latest version of your current minor line,
then upgrade to the latest available version of the new minor line.
For example, if you use an older v1.12.x version,
upgrade to the latest v1.12.x version before upgrading to the latest v1.13.x version.

For product versions and upgrade paths,
see the [Product Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.pivotal.io/compatibility-matrix.pdf).

## <a id="deprecation"></a> Pivotal Is Continuing Support for the Pre-Provisioned Service

* Changing networks and/or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.
  For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

* When errand run rules are set to **When Changed**, Ops Manager may not run the errands when the tile has relevant changes.
  Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.
  For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).


### Packages

* OSS RabbitMQ v3.7.7

* HAProxy v1.6.13

## <a id="1130"></a> v1.13.0

**Release Date**: July 20, 2018

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Supports securing communication between apps and on-demand
service instances using Transport Layer Security (TLS).
For more information, see [Preparing for TLS](./prepare-tls.html).
For ease of upgrade from previous versions, this functionality is turned off by default.

* Includes open source RabbitMQ v3.7.
  This version includes many improvements.
  For information about what is new in RabbitMQ v3.7,
  see the [RabbitMQ documentation](http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2018/02/05/whats-new-in-rabbitmq-3-7/).
  The path to upgrade the pre-provisioned service to v3.7 requires manual intervention,
  and the path to upgrade the on-demand service requires removing preexisting instances.
  For information, see [Upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF](upgrade.html).

* Smoke tests for the on-demand broker now use the system org, as is already the case for multi-tenant.

### Known Issues

This release has the following known issues:

* **[Security Issue]** The method for generating the Erlang Cookie is not secure.
  For more information about this security issue, see
    <a href="https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1279">CVE-2018-1279: RabbitMQ cluster compromise due to deterministically generated cookie</a>.
  * If you rely on the tile to generate the cookie by leaving the Erlang cookie
  field blank, see [Security Issue with the Tile Generated Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang-security-issue).
  * If you have set the Erlang Cookie explicitly in the tile configuration,
  you are not affected by this issue.

<%= partial 'bpm-issue' %>

* You cannot upgrade from PCF v.12 to PCF v1.13 on PCF v2.2.0 - v2.2.5.
  You must upgrade on PCF v2.1 or on PCF v2.2.6 or later.

* If you are upgrading RabbitMQ for PCF v1.12 to v1.13 and you use Spring Cloud Services,
  you must disable all errands in the Spring Cloud Services tile during the upgrade to ensure that the upgrade succeeds.

* Cluster scaling or changing the [Erlang Cookie](./install-config-pp.html#erlang) value require cluster downtime,
  and might result in failed deployments.
  For more information, see [Cluster Scaling Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#scaling-issue) and
[Changing the Erlang Cookie Value Known Issue](./install-config-pp.html#changing-issue).

* Changing networks and/or IP addresses for the `RabbitMQ Server` job results in a failed deployment.
  For more information, see [Changing Network or IP Addresses Results in a Failed Deployment](./changing-ips.html).

* When errand run rules are set to **When Changed**, Ops Manager may not run the errands when the tile has relevant changes.
  For more information, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).
  Pivotal recommends leaving the default run rule set to **On**.

* When on-demand service instances are enabled for TLS, the `port` property in
  `VCAP_SERVICES` for `amqp+ssl` incorrectly reports that the port is `5672`.
  The actual port used for `amqp+ssl` is `5671`.


### Packages
