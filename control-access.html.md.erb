title: Controlling Access to RabbitMQ Service Plans by Org

This topic gives you instructions for restricting access to a <%= vars.product_full %>
service plan to a specific org.

You can also limit the number of service instances by setting quotas---for instructions, see [Setting Limits for On-Demand Instances](./set-quotas.html).

## <a id="access"></a> Change Access to Service Plans

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the plan you are restricting is currently enabled for all orgs,
   you must first <strong>Disable Service Access</strong> for the plan, then grant access to the plan to specific orgs.
   Use the <strong>CF Service Access</strong> field to deactivate access in the <a href="./install-config.html#service-plan"> service plan configuration.</a></p>

To restrict access to a plan for a specific org, run this command:

```
cf enable-service-access p.rabbitmq -p PLAN_NAME -o ORG_NAME
```

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf enable-service-access p.rabbitmq -p my-cluster-plan -o my-dev-org
</pre>

For more information about the above command,
see [Access Control](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/services/access-control.html).
